  - Real-time voice input handling
  - UI feedback during voice recording
  - Error handling and status management
  - Configurable recording parameters

- Dynamic Lists
  - Checklist implementation with state management
  - Efficient list item updates

  - Error handling and recovery

### Key Dependencies and Features
- Speech-to-Text Integration
  - Voice dictation capabilities using speech_to_text package
  - Platform-specific permission handling for microphone access
  - Error handling and feedback mechanisms

- Local Notifications
  - Scheduling and managing reminders with flutter_local_notifications
  - Platform-specific notification handling
  - Background notification processing

- Social Sharing
  - WhatsApp integration using share_plus package
  - Cross-platform sharing capabilities
  - Content formatting for sharing

## Voice Commands in Flutter
- Speech recognition can be used for both dictation and command processing
- Commands can be processed by checking for specific phrases in the recognized text
- Visual feedback is important for voice interactions (confidence indicators, status messages)
- Continuous mode vs. single recognition mode offers different user experiences
- Voice commands can be used to control UI state and perform actions

## Checklist Management
- Checklist items should be immutable for proper state management
- Position tracking helps with reordering and maintaining order
- Timestamps are important for tracking changes and syncing
- Swipe-to-delete provides a natural gesture for item removal
- Text selection and cursor position management improves text input UX 

## Dart Language Insights
- Const constructors cannot use runtime values like DateTime.now()
- Use const constructors only when all values are known at compile time
- For models with runtime values, use regular constructors
- Immutability can still be achieved without const by using final fields
